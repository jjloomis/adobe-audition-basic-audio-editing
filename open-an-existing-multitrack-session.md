# Opening an existing Multitrack Session

To continue working on an existing Multitrack Session, you'll open the SESX file that you saved to your class folder.

Note: When you open an existing Multitrack Session, WAV files that have not been added to tracks will not appear in the Files area. You can import WAV files (from your project folder) to continue working with them.
