# Opening an existing Multitrack Session

To continue working on an existing Multitrack Session, you'll open the SESX file in your project folder.

Note: When you open an existing Multitrack Session, only WAV files that have been added to tracks will appear in the Files panel \(upper-left corner.\)

To work with WAV files that were previously saved or copied to your project folder, you'll need to import those WAV files into your Multitrack Session.

1. Connect to your class folder using JAMS Lab or CCL Mac.
2. Navigate to and open your project folder. 
3. Double-click your SESX file to open your Multitrack Session. 
4. To continue working with previously saved WAV files that are in your project folder, import the WAV files into Audition.
