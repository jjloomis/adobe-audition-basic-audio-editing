# Opening an Existing Multitrack Session

To continue working on an existing multitrack session, you'll open the SESX file in your project folder.

**Note**: When you open an existing multitrack session, only WAV files that have been added to audio tracks will appear in the **Files** panel \(upper-left.\)

To work with WAV files that were previously saved or copied to your project folder, you'll need to import those WAV files into your multitrack session.

1. Connect to your class folder using [JAMS Lab](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/connecting-in-jams-lab.html) or [CCL Mac](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/connecting-in-campus-computer-lab.html).
2. [Navigate](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/navigating-folder-tree.html) to and open your project folder. 
3. Double-click your SESX file to open your multitrack session. 
4. To continue working with previously saved WAV files that are in your project folder, [import the WAV files into Audition](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/adobe-audition-basic-audio-editing/content/listening-and-logging/importing-wav-files.html).
