# Warning Boxes: What to Click

## One or more files used by this Multitrack Session are located outside of the Session folder

Click **No**.

This box appears because Audition thinks your WAV files are not in your project folder \(even though they are in your project folder.\) Sometimes, Audition doesn’t immediately recognize your class folder. When this happens, Audition will try to copy your WAV files into your project folder.

Clicking **No** prevents the creation of duplicate WAV files in your project folder.

## This file is referenced in one or more multitrack sessions

Click **OK**.

This box appears because you are editing a WAV file that appears in your multitrack project. When following the JAMS Adobe Audition workflow, you usually don’t need to worry about WAV files going out of sync with other WAV files in your multitrack project \(because arranging sound bites in the multitrack project happens after you’ve cleaned up the content of your WAV files.\)

If you do edit the content of a WAV file after you’ve arranged your sound bites in your multitrack project, know that you will need to rearrange all of the sound bites that appear after the edited WAV file in your multitrack project.

## Yellow triangle with exclamation point in it

Click the triangle and select **Dismiss Warning**.

This triangle appears in the lower left corner of a multitrack project sound bite after you’ve deleted part of it in the Waveform Editor. You can dismiss this warning.

## The session 'your-project-name-here.sesx' contains files with unsaved changes

Click **Yes** \(or **Yes To All**.\)

This warning box appears if you made changes to one of your WAV files. Audition wants to know if you want to keep those changes. You should click **Yes** \(or **Yes To All** if you edited multiple WAV files.\)
