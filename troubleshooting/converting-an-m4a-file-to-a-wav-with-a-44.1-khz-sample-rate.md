# Converting an M4A file to a WAV with a 44.1 kHz Sample Rate

If you recorded audio using an iPhone or the Zoom videoconferencing application, you'll need to email the M4A file to yourself and then convert it to a WAV file with a 44.1 kHz sample rate before working with it in Audition. 

1. Find the M4A file on your phone or computer. Email it to yourself as an attachment.
2. Using a campus Mac, download the attached M4A file. Move the M4A file to your project folder. 
3. Import the M4A file into Audition.
4. In the Audition **Files** panel, double-click the M4A file to open it in the Waveform Editor.
5. Go to **File** on the menu bar and choose **Save As**.
6. In the **Save As** dialog box, click the **Change** button next to **Sample Type**. In the drop-down list choose **441000**. Click **OK**.
7. In the **Format** drop-down list, make sure **Wave PCM** is selected.
8. Click the **Browse** button and navigate to your project folder.
9. Give the file a new name in the **File Name** area \(something like "converted-filename."\) Click **OK**. The M4A will render to your project folder as a WAV with the correct sample rate.
