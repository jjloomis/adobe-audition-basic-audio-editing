# Adobe Audition CC 2015: Basic Audio Editing

Welcome to Adobe Audition CC 2015. You’ll use these instructions to create audio projects for JAMS classes. Because Adobe Audition is a destructive editing program, you’ll need to follow the JAMS audio editing workflow outlined in these instructions in order to avoid problems. The JAMS audio editing workflow will prevent you from losing portions of your WAV files as you edit on your project.
