# Warning boxes: What to click

## One or more files used by this Multitrack Session are located outside of the Session folder

Click No. This box appears because Audition thinks your WAV files are not in your project folder (even though they are in your project folder.) Sometimes, Audition doesnâ€™t immediately recognize your class folder. When this happens, Audition will try to copy your WAV files into your project folder.


## This file is referenced in one or more multitrack sessions


## Yellow triangle with exclamation point in it

## The session 'your-project-name-here.sesx' contains files with unsaved changes
