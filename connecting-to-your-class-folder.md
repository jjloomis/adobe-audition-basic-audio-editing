# Connecting to Your Class Folder

Before you begin working in Audition, connect to your class folder using a [JAMS Lab](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/connecting-in-jams-lab.html) or [CCL Mac](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/connecting-in-campus-computer-lab.html). Your project folder \(and all audio files related to your project\) will live in this location.
