# Adding Range Markers to a WAV file

As you listen to your audio file, you’ll probably find yourself thinking, “I want to use this sound bite in my project—it’s a keeper.” To make a note of that keeper sound bite, you’ll add a Range Marker to your WAV file.

Adding Range Markers to WAV files is an essential part of the JAMS audio editing workflow. Later, you’ll use your Range Markers to create sound bite WAV files that will be added to audio tracks in your Multitrack Session.

1. While in the Waveform Editor, click the **Markers** tab on the left.
2. Hover your mouse pointer in the waveform area. It should appear as an I-bean pointer.
3. To add a Range Marker to your WAV file, click and drag from slightly before the start of your keeper sound bite area until slightly after the end of it. \(This extra audio at the beginning and end of your keeper sound bite is pad. You’ll use it while editing your Multitrack Session.\) Your keeper sound bite area will appear highlighted.
4. With your keeper sound bite area highlighted in the waveform, click the **Add Cue Marker** button in the Marker area on the left. This will add a Range Marker \(probably named "Marker 01"\) to your WAV file.
5. In the Markers area on the left, click the default Range Marker name \(probably “Marker 01”\) and give your keeper sound bite area a better name to help you remember its content. Follow [file and folder naming conventions](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/file-and-folder-naming-conventions.html).
6. Repeat this process to add Range Markers to all of your keeper sound bite areas.
