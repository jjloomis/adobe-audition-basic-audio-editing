# Creating a Multitrack Session

Creating a Multitrack Session \(SESX file\) also creates a project folder. Your WAV files and SESX file need to live in this project folder. If any of these files are not in your project folder, your Audition project will not work.

1. Go to File on the menu bar and select New.
2. From the fly-out menu, select Multitrack Session.
3. In the New Multitrack Session dialog box, make the following changes:&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; Change Sample Rate to 44100. &lt;br&gt;In the Folder Location area, click Browse. Navigate to and select your class folder.&lt;br&gt; In the Session Name field, enter a name for your project.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/pre&gt;&lt;\/code&gt;
4. When finished, click OK.
