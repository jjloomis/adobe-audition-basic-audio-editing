# Listening to Your Audio in the Waveform Editor

In Audition, youâ€™ll use the Waveform Editor to listen to your WAV files. Later, you'll use the Waveform Editor to create sound bites and edit the content of your WAV files.

1. In the Files panel \(upper-left corner\), double-click a WAV file. The WAV file will open in the Waveform Editor. 
2. Click the **Play** button at the bottom of the screen or press the spacebar to play your WAV file.
3. If necessary, click in the Timeline to reposition Playhead.
4. Click the **Stop** button or press the spacebar to stop playing the WAV file. Note: Do not use the **Pause** button at the bottom of the screen. Only use **Play** or **Stop**.
