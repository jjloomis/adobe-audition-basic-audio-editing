# Listening and logging

Listening and logging is the notetaking phase of the Audition editing workflow. After creating a Multitrack Session, you'll copy the WAV files on your Zoom into your project folder. You'll note your keeper sound bites by adding Range Markers to your WAV files. Then, using your Range Markers, you'll export keeper sound bite WAV files into your project folder.

During this phase, you'll also begin writing your draft script.
