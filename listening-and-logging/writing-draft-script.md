# Writing a draft script

As you identify your best sound bites, begin working on your script in a Word document. (Follow JAMS scripting format.) Transcribe the best sound bites and begin placing them in a logical order in your script. (If your piece uses narration, begin writing voice-over copy that will tell the rest of the story and serve as transitions between sound bites and natural sound.
