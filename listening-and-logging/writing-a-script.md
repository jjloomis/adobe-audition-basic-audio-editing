# Writing a Script

After you’ve carefully logged your video, you’re ready to write the script. You need a script, or road map, for every audio story you produce. There are many different audio story formats: interviewee’s voice only, question-and-answer, narrated question-and-answer, natural sound-only.

The following instructions are for an audio “package” format, which includes interviewee sound bites plus reporter narration.

## Introduction

On a Word doc, write the host/anchor introduction first. This is a sentence or two that a host or news anchor would read to introduce your story on the radio OR that would appear on a Media Milwaukee web page to set up your story.

_Example: Hundreds of UW-Milwaukee students filled the Union ballroom for the spring career fair. Eduardo Lopez reports._

## Package script

An audio “package” is a story usually made up of several interviews, possibly natural sound, and the reporter’s narration.

Start writing your package script using the best sound bites and natural sound you have to work with. Place the transcribed sound bites and natural sound pops in a logical order on a Word doc. For radio news stories, sound bites are often around 8-13 seconds long. For longer stories or documentaries, they can run longer.

After you’ve arranged all your best sound bites and natural sound on the Word doc, you’re ready to write narration – that’s the “voice over” you will record to tie the story together. Use narration 1\) to add facts, info and detail about the story and 2\) to transition from sound bite to sound bite.

Listeners won’t know which interviewee’s voice they’re hearing unless you tell them. _Example: LaToya Edwards is principal of Greendale High School._

Avoid “echoes” in your narration. That means repeating the same words or phrases in the narration that are already in the sound bite. Read your narration out loud to be sure it sounds clear and conversational. Review all audio writing resources on Canvas for guidance on setting up sound bites and effective writing.

End your package with a sign-off: _For Media Milwaukee, I’m Eduardo Lopez._
