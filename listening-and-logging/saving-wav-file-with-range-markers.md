# Saving a WAV File with Range Markers

After creating your [range markers](/listening-and-logging/adding-range-markers-to-wav-file.md/#range-marker), youâ€™ll need to save your work. This will add all of your [range markers](/listening-and-logging/adding-range-markers-to-wav-file.md/#range-marker) to your WAV file.

* In the waveform editor, go to **File** on the menu bar and choose **Save**. Your WAV file will save to its original location. The [range markers](/listening-and-logging/adding-range-markers-to-wav-file.md/#range-marker) are now part of the WAV file.
