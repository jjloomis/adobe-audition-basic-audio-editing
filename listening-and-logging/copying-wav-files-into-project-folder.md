# Copying WAV files from a Zoom to your project folder

Before you can work in Audition, youâ€™ll need to copy the WAV files from your Zoom to your project folder.

## Zoom H2n

1. Connect to your class folder using a [JAMS Lab](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/connecting-in-jams-lab.html) or [CCL Mac](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/connecting-in-ccl.html).
2. Make sure Zoom H2n is off. Note: The Zoom H2n must be off in order for this process to work.
3. Connect the Zoom to a Mac using the USB cable. The Zoom H2n will power on. Connection options will appear on the Zoom's screen.
4. On the Zoom H2n, use the **Play** wheel to select **SD Card Reader**.
5. H2N\_SD will appear on the Mac Desktop \(on right\). Double-click the H2N\_SD drive to open it.
6. In H2N\_SD, double-click the Stereo folder to open it.
7. In the Stereo folder, double-click FOLDER01 to open it. All of your WAV files are in this folder. Your WAV files will have the following name format: ZOOM000X.WAV. Note: The date and time stamps for the WAV files will not be correct.
8. Press **Command** **A** \(on keyboard\) to select all of the WAV files in FOLDER01. Copy all of the WAV files into your project folder. Note: You may need to [open multiple Finder windows](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/opening-multiple-finder-windows.html) and [navigate to your project folder](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/navigating-folder-tree.html) in order to do this.
