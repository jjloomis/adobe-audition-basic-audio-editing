# Copying WAV Files From a Zoom to Your Project Folder

Before editing the audio you captured with your **Zoom H2n** recorder, you'll copy the WAV files on its SD card into your project folder.

**Note**: Never import WAV files into **Audition** directly from a **Zoom H2n** recorder. Copy the WAV files into your project folder. Then import the WAV files into Audition from your project folder.
