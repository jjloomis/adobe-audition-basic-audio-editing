# Exporting Audio of Range Markers

After saving your WAV file, youâ€™ll export the audio of your [range markers](/listening-and-logging/adding-range-markers-to-wav-file.md/#range-marker) to your project folder. This process uses the audio within your [range markers](/listening-and-logging/adding-range-markers-to-wav-file.md/#range-marker) to create sound bite WAV files in your project folder.

1. In the **Markers** tab \(left panel\), click the top range marker to select it. 
2. Press and hold the **Shift** key \(on keyboard.\)
3. While holding the **Shift** key, click the bottom range marker. All of the [range markers](/listening-and-logging/adding-range-markers-to-wav-file.md/#range-marker) in the Markers tab will become highlighted. \(With all of the Range Markers selected, you can let go of the **Shift** key.\)
4. Press and hold the **Control** key \(on keyboard\), and click within the highlighted [range markers](/listening-and-logging/adding-range-markers-to-wav-file.md/#range-marker).
5. From the fly-out menu, choose **Export Audio of Selected Range Markers**. 
6. In the Export Audio Range dialog box, click the **Browse** button. Navigate to and select your project folder.
7. Click the **Export** button. The audio from your Range Markers will be saved as sound bite WAV files in your project folder.
