4. Press and hold the **Control** key \(on keyboard\), and click within the highlighted **range markers**.
5. From the fly-out menu, choose **Export Audio of Selected Range Markers**. 
6. In the Export Audio Range dialog box, click the **Browse** button. Navigate to and select your project folder.
7. Click the **Export** button. The audio from your **range markers** will be saved as sound bite WAV files in your project folder.
