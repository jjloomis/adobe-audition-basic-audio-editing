# Recording Narration with Zoom H2N

When the script is complete and your instructor has reviewed it, you’re ready to record narration.

Use the Zoom H2n to record your narration just as you would use it to interview someone else.

Find a quiet place to record. Rooms with carpet and low ceilings are best because they minimize echo-y ambient sound.

Follow recording instructions for your Zoom. Wear earbuds. Hold the microphone close to your mouth so levels average around -9db.

With your script in front of you, read and record all of your sentences/paragraphs of narration in one audio file. Do not start and stop. Pause between “chunks” of narration. If you mess up, that’s ok. Keep going.

When you’re done, stop the recorder and follow Zoom instructions for transferring your audio file to your project folder. In the project folder, rename the new file Narration-Main.WAV.

Add range markers to the Narration file just as you would to an interview, highlighting the “keeper” chunks of narration that match your script.

Follow instructions for exporting audio of range markers.
