# Working with Other Audio Formats

In addition to WAV files, you can work with other audio file formats \(MP3, [M4A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lossless#Codec), etc.\) in Audition. When working with these other audio formats, the editing process remains the same.

Note: Audition may create a Conformed-Files folder within your project folder. Do not delete, move or rename this folder.

1. Copy your additional audio files into your project folder.
2. Import your additional audio files into Audition \(following the same process used when importing WAV files.\)
3. In the Files panel, double-click an audio file to open it in the Waveform Editor.
4. Add Range Markers to the sections of the audio file that you would like use in your project. Give your Range Markers appropriate names in the Markers panel. \(Follow file and folder naming conventions.\)
5. Export the audio of your Range Markers to your project folder.
6. Import your sound bite audio files into Audition.
7. Switch back to your Multitrack Session. 
8. Add your sound bite audio files to tracks in your Multitrack Session.
