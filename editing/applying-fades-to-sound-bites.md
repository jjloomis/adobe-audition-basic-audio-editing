# Applying fades to sound bites

To apply a fade to the beggining or end of a sound bite, select a sound bite and then click and drag its fade handles. Note: Fade handles will only appear in sound bite that has been selected in an audio track. 

As a general rule, every sound bite in an audio track should have a slight fade applied to the beginning and end of it. This creates smooth transitions from sound bite to sound bite. Make sure the first audio file in your timeline has a very slight fade applied at the beginning.

1. Select a sound bite in an audio track. The sound bite will become highlighted.
2. In the upper left and right corners of the sound bite, youâ€™ll see small squares. These are the fade handles.
3. Click and drag the fade handles to apply fades to the beginning and end of the sound bite.
4. Repeat this process for all of your sound bites.

Note: As you click and drag your fade handles, aim for a fade shape pictured on the sound bites below. The shape of a fade affects the speed and way in way in which sound bites fade in and out.
