# Editing a Sound Bite in the Waveform Editor

After you’ve created a logical order for your sound bites in the multitrack session, you’ll need to adjust the content of your sound bites \(making them shorter and tighter, adjusting audio levels, deleting “uhs,” etc.\) To do these types of edits, you’ll use the waveform editor.

* In an audio track, double-click the sound bite you want to edit. Audition will open the sound bite in the waveform editor. **Note**: The edits you make in the waveform editor are destructive. These edits will change the sound bite WAV files in your project folder.
