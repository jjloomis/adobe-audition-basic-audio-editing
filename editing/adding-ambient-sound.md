# Adding ambient sound

Sometimes itâ€™s difficult to stagger two sound bites together without creating an edit that sounds abrupt or unnatural. In these situations, you can use your recorded ambient sound (or room tone) to create a natural rhythm in your project.

1.	Go to File on the menu bar, choose Import and select File. 
2.	Navigate to and select your room tone WAV file. Click Import. Your ambient sound WAV file will appear in the Files area.
3.	Click and drag your ambient sound WAV file from the Files area to an empty audio track.
4.	If your ambient sound is room tone, you can repeat this process. If your ambient sound is an event (a soccer game, sounds in a grocery store, etc.), refrain from adding more than one instance of the ambient sound WAV file to your Multitrack Session. 
5.	Clean up the beginning and end of your ambient sound sound bite. (See Fine-tuning sound bites.)
