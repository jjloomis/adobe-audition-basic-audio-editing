# Adjusting audio level within a sound bite in the Waveform Editor

Ideally, the volume of your waveform should consistently range from -12 to -6 decibels. In the Levels panel, you should see the levels going from green into yellow during playback.

Levels may appear red on occasion, but they should not trigger the peak indicators. Peak indicators are the squares at the end of the level meters that stay red if your audio signal is too hot \(an audio signal exceeding 0 decibels that causes distortion.\)

If there are points in your waveform that are too high or low in volume, you can adjust the amplitude of those areas.

1. In the Waveform Editor, hover your mouse pointer over the waveform until it becomes an I-beam pointer. 
2. Click and drag to select the waveform area you’d like to adjust. The area will appear highlighted and the Adjust Amplitude tool will appear.
3. Use the dial in the Adjust Amplitude tool to change to volume of the selected waveform area. It’s best to adjust your volume in increments of 3 decibels. Play back your audio as you make your adjustments and always wear headphones as you edit.
