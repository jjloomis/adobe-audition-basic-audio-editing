# Switching Between Waveform Editor and Multitrack Session

After working with sound bites in the waveform editor, you'll need to switch back to your multitrack session.

* In the **Files** panel \(upper-left\), double-click your SESX file.

Once you’re back in your multitrack session, you may notice yellow triangles with exclamation points in them near your sound bites. These are helpful warnings. The multitrack session references what’s happening in the waveform editor. So, if you delete part of a sound bite in the waveform editor, the overall length of the sound bite becomes shorter in the multitrack session.
