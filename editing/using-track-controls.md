# Using Track Controls

In a Multritrack Session, track controls apply changes to all sound bites in the audio track.

| Track control | How it works |
| --- | --- |
| Name field | This field allows you to change the name of an audio track. |
| Solo | Mutes all tracks except for this audio track. |
| Arm for Record | Used for multitrack recording in Audition. Not used in JAMS audio editing workflow. |
| Track Volume | Controls the overall volume of the audio track. |
| Pan | Controls where the sound comes from in the stereo spectrum \(right, left, or centered.\) |
| Peak Indicators | Appear red if a track is too hot \(audio signal exceeding 0 decibels and causing distortion.\) |
