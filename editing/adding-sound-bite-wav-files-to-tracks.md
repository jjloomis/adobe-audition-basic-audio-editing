# Adding sound bite WAV files to tracks

1. Click and drag a sound bite WAV file from the Files area to an audio track. 
2. To position a sound bite in the audio track, click and drag its titlebar (green bar at top of sound bite.) Be sure the first sound bite is flush with the start of its audio track.   
3. The sound bites of each interviewee should occupy two audio tracks. Stagger the sound bites between the first and second audio tracksâ€”alternating between both.
4. The pad (extra audio) of each sound bite should slightly overlap the other. Zoom In to adjust the sound bites.
