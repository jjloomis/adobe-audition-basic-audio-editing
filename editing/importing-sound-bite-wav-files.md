# Importing sound bite WAV files

Before you can add your sound bite WAV files to your Mulitrack Session, youâ€™ll need to Import them into the Files area of Audition.

1. Go to File on the menu bar, choose Import and select File. 
2. Navigate to and select your project folder. 
3. Import your sound bite WAV files. (Do not Import the PKF files.)

Note: Audio files cannot be saved to your Multitrack Session until they are added to an audio track. If you open your Multitrack Session and do not see audio files in the Files area, you will need to repeat this process before proceeding with your project.
