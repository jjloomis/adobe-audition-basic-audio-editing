# Editing

During the editing phase of the workflow, you'll bring your sound bite WAV files into your Multitrack Session and begin laying them out spacially. After arranging your sound bites in the order in which you would like to appear, you'll edit the content of the sound bites using the Waveform Editior. You'll fine-tune the cadence of your sound bites in your Multirack Session and add additional audio files if they are needed in your project.
