# Editing

During the editing phase of the workflow, you'll bring your sound bite WAV files into your Multitrack Session. After arranging the sound bites in the order you would like them to appear, you'll edit the content of your sound bites using the Waveform Editior. Then you'll fine-tune the cadence of your sound bites in your Multirack Session and add any audio files your project needs.
