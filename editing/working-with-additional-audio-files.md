5. In the Markers area, select all of your Range Markers.
6. Control-click the selected Range Markers.
7. In the fly-out menu, select Export Audio of Selected Range Markers.
8. Navigate to and select your project folder.
9. Click Export.
10. Go to File on the menu bar, choose Import and select File.
11. Navigate to and select your additional sound bite WAV files. Click Import. Your additional sound bite WAV files will appear in the Files area.
12. Add your additional sound bite WAV files to new (empty) audio tracks in your Multitrack Session. Rearrange your sound bite WAV files as needed.
