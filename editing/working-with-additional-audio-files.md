# Working with Additional WAV Files

Up until this point, you’ve been working with sound bites WAV files that were exported from your interview WAV files. Sometimes, you’ll need to work with additional WAV files that contain suplemental material \(ambient sound, a music performance, more interview material, etc.\)

1. [Copy your additional WAV files](../listening-and-logging/copying-wav-files-into-project-folder.md) into your project folder.
2. [Import your additional WAV files](../listening-and-logging/importing-wav-files.md) into Audition.
3. In the **Files** panel, double-click a WAV file to [open it in the waveform editor](../listening-and-logging/listening-to-wav-files-in-waveform-editor.md).
4. [Add range markers](../listening-and-logging/adding-range-markers-to-wav-file.md) to the sections of the WAV file that you would like use in your project. Give your range markers appropriate names in the **Markers** panel. Follow [file and folder naming conventions](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/file-and-folder-naming-conventions.html).
5. [Export the audio of your range markers](../listening-and-logging/exporting-audio-of-range-markers.md) to your project folder.
6. [Import your sound bite WAV files](importing-sound-bite-wav-files.md) into Audition.
7. [Switch back to your multitrack session](switching-between-waveform-editor-and-multitrack-session.md). 
8. [Add your sound bite WAV files to tracks](adding-sound-bite-wav-files-to-tracks.md) in your Multitrack Session.
