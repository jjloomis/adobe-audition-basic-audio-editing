# Working with additional audio files

Up until this point, you’ve been working with keeper sound bites that were exported from your interview WAV file(s.) Sometimes, you’ll have other audio files that contain room tone, narration, or more sound bites.

1. In the Multitrack Session, go to File, choose Import and select File. 
2. Import any audio files you want to add to your Multitrack Session.

Note: Audio files cannot be saved to your Multitrack Session until they are added to an audio track. If you open your Multitrack Session and do not see audio files in the Files area, you’ll need to repeat this process before proceeding with your project.
