# Working with additional WAV files

Up until this point, you’ve been working with sound bites WAV files that were exported from your interview WAV files. Sometimes, you’ll have additional WAV files that contain room tone, music, or more sound bites.

1. In the Multitrack Session, go to File, choose Import and select File. 
2. Import any audio files you want to add to your Multitrack Session.

Note: Audio files cannot be saved to your Multitrack Session until they are added to an audio track. If you open your Multitrack Session and do not see audio files in the Files area, you’ll need to repeat this process before proceeding with your project.

1. Copy your additional WAV files to your project folder.
2. Import your additional WAV files into Audition.
3. In the Files area, double-click a WAV file to open it in the Waveform Editor.
4. Add Range Markers to the sections of the WAV file that you would like use in your project. Give your Range Markers appropriate names in the Markers area. (Follow File and Folder Naming Conventions.)

5. In the Markers area, select all of your Range Markers.

6. Control-click the selected Range Markers.

7. In the fly-out menu, select Export Audio of Selected Range Markers.

8. Navigate to and select your project folder.

9. Click Export.

10. Go to File on the menu bar, choose Import and select File.

11. Navigate to and select your additional sound bite WAV files. Click Import. Your additional sound bite WAV files will appear in the Files area.

12. Add your additional sound bite WAV files to a new (empty) audio track in your Multitrack Session. Rearrange your sound bite WAV files as needed.
