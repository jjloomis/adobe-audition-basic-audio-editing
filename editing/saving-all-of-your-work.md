# Saving All of Your Work

1. Go to **File** on the menu bar and choose **Save** or **Save All**. **Note**: Since your project already has a name and location, never choose **Save As**. 
2. If a dialog box appears that says: **The session contains files with unsaved changes. Would you like to save changes?** Click **Yes** or **Yes To All**. 
3. If a dialog box appears that says: **One or more media files used by this Multitrack Session are located outside of the Session folder. Would you like to copy these media files to the Session folder?** Click **No**.
4. Close Adobe Audition.
